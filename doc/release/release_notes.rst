    :date: 2024-08-01

    .. change:: changed

        Improved the :func:`pytest_discover_tests` function to use an

    :date: 2024-05-06

    .. change:: fixed

        Updated test collection logic to ensure that the 'rootdir' is a
        real path. Previously, running the tests from a symlinked directory
        could result in errors when discovering 'conftests' configurations.

        .. seealso:: https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12291

.. release:: 0.5.1
    :date: 2024-03-17

        collection fails.

.. release:: 0.4.1
    :date: 2024-03-17

    .. change:: fixed

        As of Hatching v1.22, dynamic dependencies during build time must
        be imported lazily. Therefore, the backend script has been updated
        to import 'pytest' only when the build hook is called.

        .. seealso::

            `BuildHookInterface.dependencies
            <https://hatch.pypa.io/dev/plugins/build-hook/reference/#hatchling.builders.hooks.plugin.interface.BuildHookInterface.dependencies>`_

        environment variables are represented as strings before
        serializing the CTest commands.

        Updated Github CI script to run all tests once a week.

    .. change:: new
